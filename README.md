## Protecting Data in a World of Re-Identification Risks

Welcome to the VICEROY hands-on cybersecurity training on data anonymization and privacy.

This workshop explores a critical question in modern computing:
Why does “anonymous” data so often fail to protect people?

Across three interactive sessions, you will take on both defender and attacker roles to understand how re-identification happens in practice, how anonymization techniques work, and why many privacy protections break under real-world conditions.

This is a lab-driven workshop. You will work directly with datasets, write code, analyze results, and think like an adversary.



## What You Will Learn
By the end of this training, you will be able to:
- Explain how re-identification attacks work
- Identify quasi-identifiers and privacy risks in datasets
- Apply k-anonymity, l-diversity, and t-closeness
- Evaluate privacy versus data utility tradeoffs
- Understand the intuition behind differential privacy
- Think adversarially about data privacy systems



## Workshop Structure

### Session 1: Re-Identification and Linkage Attacks
You will analyze “anonymized” data and successfully re-identify individuals using auxiliary information.

### Session 2: Practical Data Anonymization
You will apply anonymization techniques and observe where they succeed and where they fail.

### Session 3: Attacks, Evaluation, and Differential Privacy
You will evaluate anonymized data from an attacker’s perspective and explore how differential privacy changes risk.



## Technical Requirements
- Laptop (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Basic Python experience
- Comfort working with data tables

No prior experience with data privacy is required.



## Ethical Use Statement
All datasets used in this workshop are synthetic and created for educational purposes.
Techniques demonstrated here are intended to improve privacy and security, not to exploit real individuals or systems.



## Getting Started
Follow the setup instructions in [setup_instructions.md](setup_instructions.md).

Do not modify the datasets unless instructed.
